Governance Framework Summary

Risk tiers: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH

Drivers: domain, automation level, presence of sensitive indicators, and prohibited/high-risk patterns (e.g., surveillance/profiling).

Outputs:

Required controls (e.g., documentation, privacy review, bias review, logging)

Required approvals (e.g., system owner, privacy/legal/security, executive sponsor depending on tier)

Auditability: Each run can generate artifacts (log + memo) documenting the decision and rationale.
